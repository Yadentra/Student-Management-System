# Test Plan for Student Management System

## Introduction
This test plan outlines the approach, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the Student Management System. The goal is to ensure that all features are functional and meet requirements.

## Objectives
- Verify that each feature (add, display, search, delete) works as expected.
- Ensure the system handles invalid inputs gracefully.
- Validate data persistence in `students.txt`.

## Scope
The testing will cover:
- Functional testing of each feature.
- Input validation checks.
- File handling for data storage (`students.txt`).

## Testing Approach
1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual functions (e.g., `addStudent`, `searchStudent`) to verify correctness.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensuring all components (like reading/writing to file) work together as expected.
3. **User Interface Testing**: Checking the console prompts and messages for clarity.
