3. **Search Student**:
   - The system should allow users to search for a student by their ID.
   - If the student exists, their details should be displayed.

4. **Delete Student**:
   - The system should allow users to delete a student record by ID.
   - The record should be removed from `students.txt` permanently.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**:
   - The application should be user-friendly with clear prompts and instructions.
   
2. **Reliability**:
   - The system should handle invalid inputs gracefully and ensure data integrity during operations.

3. **Performance**:
   - The system should be able to handle multiple entries efficiently without noticeable delay.
